# OpenConfig

OpenConfig is a an example open source software project that is used to convert configuration files from one IDE/text editor to another. For example, if a developer uses both Visual Studio Code and JetBrains' IntelliJ, OpenConfig will enable Visual Studio Code users to import their configuration file from IntelliJ with ease. OpenConfig could potentially generate revenue by having users pay a subscription fee after going over a certain amount of files converted. Users with a subscription would be able to convert an unlimited amount of configuration files in addition to having a wider range of configuration file types to convert to/from. As such, the license for this project is the MIT license; if developers want to create their own version/modifications of OpenConfig they are more than welcome to do so under the MIT license.
